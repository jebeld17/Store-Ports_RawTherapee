# Transparency regarding RawTherapee in the Microsoft Store, via Store Ports.
You've asked for transparency. We've got it! This repository is for the XnConvert port project to the Microsoft Store via Store Ports. 

Raw Therapee for Windows 10 devices via the Microsoft Store is compiled using a three-step conversion process:
  1. Non-administrative portable install is invoked on original portable installation .zip. (Found at https://rawtherapee.com/downloads.)
  2. Non-administrative portable installed program, along with all it's compenents and files are exported to a sandboxed workspace using the Microsoft Desktop App Converter.
  3. Converted/Exported non-administrative portable installation is archived into a .AppX package to be uploaded to the Microsoft Store.
  
In addition, every release in the Microsoft Store is verified for authenticity, security, and quality by Microsoft before being published.

Enjoy Raw Therapee on your Windows 10 devices, all without turning S-Mode off!

Now that we've got all that out of the way, I'd like to invite you to download XnConvert in the Microsoft Store at https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NTW98887KCD.

Thanks you so much, and enjoy.
